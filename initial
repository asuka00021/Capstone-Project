 Cigar box, cafÃ© au lait, and dried tobacco aromas are followed by coffee and cherry flavors, with barrel spices lingering on the finish. The wood gets a bit out front but it still delivers enjoyment.                                                                                                     :     3  
 Gravenstein apple, honeysuckle and jasmine aromas show on the relatively boisterous nose of this bottling from a large vineyard on Highway 46 east of Paso Robles. There is compellingly grippy texture to the sip, with ripe flavors of pear and honeydew melon. A salty acidity takes it to the next level.:     3  
 Ripe plum, game, truffle, leather and menthol are some of the aromas you'll find on this earthy wine. The tightly wound palate offers dried black cherry, chopped sage, mint and roasted coffee bean alongside raspy tannins that leave a mouth-drying finish.                                               :     3  
 Seductively tart in lemon pith, cranberry and pomegranate, this refreshing, light-bodied quaff is infinitely enjoyable, both on its own or at the table. It continues to expand on the palate into an increasing array of fresh flavors, finishing in cherry and orange.                                     :     3  
 Stalky aromas suggest hay and green herbs, with raspberry in the backdrop. It's hot and short in terms of mouthfeel, with herbal flavors leading the way and berry fruit running behind. Dry red fruit and herbal notes dominate the finish.                                                                 :     3  
 This zesty red has pretty aromas that suggest small red berry, blue flower and a whiff of moist soil. The vibrant palate offers sour cherry, pomegranate and a hint of anise alongside zesty acidity and refined tannins.                                                                                    :     3

 Cigar box, cafÃ© au lait, and dried tobacco aromas are followed by coffee and cherry flavors, with barrel spices lingering on the finish. The wood gets a bit out front but it still delivers enjoyment.                                                                                                     :     3  
 Gravenstein apple, honeysuckle and jasmine aromas show on the relatively boisterous nose of this bottling from a large vineyard on Highway 46 east of Paso Robles. There is compellingly grippy texture to the sip, with ripe flavors of pear and honeydew melon. A salty acidity takes it to the next level.:     3  
 Ripe plum, game, truffle, leather and menthol are some of the aromas you'll find on this earthy wine. The tightly wound palate offers dried black cherry, chopped sage, mint and roasted coffee bean alongside raspy tannins that leave a mouth-drying finish.                                               :     3  
 Seductively tart in lemon pith, cranberry and pomegranate, this refreshing, light-bodied quaff is infinitely enjoyable, both on its own or at the table. It continues to expand on the palate into an increasing array of fresh flavors, finishing in cherry and orange.                                     :     3  
 Stalky aromas suggest hay and green herbs, with raspberry in the backdrop. It's hot and short in terms of mouthfeel, with herbal flavors leading the way and berry fruit running behind. Dry red fruit and herbal notes dominate the finish.                                                                 :     3  
 This zesty red has pretty aromas that suggest small red berry, blue flower and a whiff of moist soil. The vibrant palate offers sour cherry, pomegranate and a hint of anise alongside zesty acidity and refined tannins.                                                                                    :     3
